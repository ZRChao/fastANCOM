# Manual of fastANCOM

A quick start for fastANCOM. fastANCOM is a simple and easy to operate R package, it aims to perform analysis of compositional microbiome data (ANCOM) at a fast speed.

# A toy example Poission

Before general simulation comparison, we first present some results of a toy data generated from Poission to show how fastANCOM works. 
We called the results calculated from the log-ratio-transformed data as the **Joint model** and the results constructed based on the results from the log-transformed data as the **Marginal model**.
We shown that the consistence between the results calculated based on the marginal model and the results calculated based on the joint model directly.
We also shown that fastANCOM could provide a better effect size estimation than others.

# The simulation supplementary for fastANCOM

The generation simulation based on Poission-gamma mixture model were done to compare the performance o fastANCOM with other DA methods. 

# Real data application
